Basically, you can upload an image, click anywhere on it, and add instructions, called pins (or tags). Each pin can be found on the image with a label where you clicked! You can also find them on the right by clicking the arrow, which will reveal a menu with all your tags! In the future, we will offer more functionalities with this tool while we wait to discover what it might be useful for, ahahaha."
